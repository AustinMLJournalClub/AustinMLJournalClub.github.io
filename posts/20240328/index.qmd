description: Amidst the LLM hype in ML, algorithmic bias is continued being overlooked although they still have major impact on critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. This seminal paper from 2019 found racial bias in a widely used healthcare algorithm, which used a problematic proxy (healthcare cost) as a target instead of what really matters, patient's sickness. The paper is a few years old but the message is still relevant, and we also get to discuss what's happened since then.

## Why this paper?

Fresh out of academia and at my first job, I remember being surprised by the great power I was able to wield as the main data scientist in the team. A few lines of my code could easily have cascading impact on business decisions. And (as is often the case) since management didn't care much about technical details, this power gave me a sense of grave responsibility, which was honestly often terrifying. To this day, this sense is something I try to remind myself of, especially because ML systems are getting more complex and we still have very little accountability for ML. So in a way, every ML practitioner is the first line of defense. And this resonsibility is more critical if one is working in an high-impact domain such as healthcare.

These days it feels like ML is all about LLMs and AI assistants. But algorthmic bias is still widespread, and unfortunately it's even more overshadowed by this massive hype. This seminal paper from 2019 identified racial bias in a healthcare algorithm and discussed the problem of label choice bias. I find this paper still relevent because this bias can easily sneak when building datasets and algorithms. Since the paper is a few years old, it will be interesting to discuss what's happened since then.

## Paper summary

### Abstract
- At a given score (algorithm estimate), Black patients are much sicker than White
- The algorithm uses healthcare cost as target (proxy), not the sickness itself
- Label choice bias: the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can cause algorithmic bias

### Introduction

Many examples
- these examples still exist

Difficulty of empricial investigation
- proprietary algos -> must work "from the outside" (creative, audit)
  - still limiting: difficult to understand how and why
  - training data, objective function, prediction method

this study: high-risk care management system
- rich data, live, scaled
- risk prediction tool
- used for 200M in the US 
- high-risk care management system
  - provide care for complex medical needs (expensive)
  - effective in saving cost and improving outcome
  - resource is limited: use alorithm to prioritize **who will benefit the most**

**algorithm in context** (from supplementary)
- obamacare -> pressure on hospitals to reduce health care cost
- causes development of "high risk care management" programs
  - early identification of high risk patient -> reduce cost (like ER visit)

figure out "who will benefit the most"
- causal inference problem
- assumption: "those with the greatest needs will benefit the most"
- target: "health care needs"

rare opportunity
- access to everything: data, objective function, prediction
- not a unique algorithm: widely used

implications of the study
- many analogies (risk assessment tools)
- importance and opportunity of studying bias in healthcare algo ("in its own right")

### Data and analytic strategy

#### Data
- large academic hospital
- 2013-2015
- primary: white vs. black (self-reporting)
  - disadvantage: lack of intersectional racial/ethnic identities
- sample size
  - black: 6k (12k patient-years)
  - white: 40k (90k patient-years)
  - "patient-years": 1 patient-year = data collected for a patient in a calendar year

#### algorithm scores
- generated for each patient during the enrollment period
- > 97%: automatically "identified" as enrolled (not guaranteed for enrollment)
- > 55%: referred to their PCP for their opinion
- **program run 3x a year: patients whose scores > threshold (97%)**

#### main methodology
- fairness metrics
  - calibration
  - statistical parity (demographic parity): proportion of C-suite member ratio men vs. women
  - not possible to optimize all metrics simultaneously
- this study: calibration
  - E[Y|R, W] = E[Y|R, B]
    - Y: interest
    - R: risk score
- what we do
  - R_{i, t}: risk score given patient i in year t given X_{i, t-1}
  - H_{i, t}: realized health
  - C_{i, t}: actual cost 
  - **how well R is calibrated across race for H (or C)**

#### measuring H and C
- H: health record data, diagnoses, lab results, vital signs, etc.
- C: insurance claims on utilization, outpatient/ER visit, hospitalization, health care costs

#### **supp**: algo implementation
- label: C (total medical expenditures)
- features: insurance claim data
  - demographics
  - insurance type
  - ICD-9 (international classification of diseases code) diagnosis and procedure codes
  - prescribed medications
  - encounters, categorized by type of service (surgical, radiology, etc.)
  - billed amounts, categorized by type (outpatient, dialysis, etc.)
- **algo is run 3 times a year** 

### Health disparities conditional on risk score

#### measure H: comorbidity score
- total number of chronic illnesses over year t = **a measure of medical complexity; correlates w/ treatment effect of care management programs**
- **more biological measure (from eletronic health records; EHR) are also used: measure for severity (not just presence)**
  - **these data need to be cleaned extensively; usually not available for model building; hard to validate**
  - **in the analysis, the authors analzed the difference in these values between black and white**

#### Fig 1A: mean comorbidity vs. risk score
- at the same risk score, Blacks have significantly more illness than Whites
- 97%: black 4.8, white 3.8

#### Meaning of this score discrepancy
- less healthy blacks = more healthy whites -> same score -> substantial disparities in program screening
- use counterfactual to measure this
  - counterfactual: no racial bias

#### Additional robustness checks related to program effect

Does the program itself have an effect?

1. Predict H_{t-1} instead of H_{t}: no racial difference 
2. Compare enrolled vs. unenrolled: no difference (**is it though?**)
3. 

#### Fig 2: blacks are substantially less healthy than whites
- across many biomarkers
- at any levels of algorithm predictions

### Mechanisms of bias

- algorithm excludes race
- target: cost
- in terms of cost, it's well calibrated between white and black (no bias)
- why then?
  - Fig 3B: at a given level of health, Black generate lower costs than Whites
  - Blacks also generate very different kinds of costs
    - more costs related to ER and dialysis
    - fewer inpatient surgical and outpatient specialist costs

#### Why this happens

1. poor patients face substantial barriers to accessing health care, even the insured ones
   1. geography, transportation
   2. demans from job, child care
   3. knowledge of reasons to seek care
2. cost directly affected by race
   1. **taste-based discrmination**: employers' prejudice or dislikes in an organisational culture rooted in prohibited grounds can have negative results in hiring minority workers
      1. One of the leading causes of labor market discrimination (the other: statistical discrimination)
      2. employers' preference for employees of certain groups is unrelated to their preference for more productive employees
   2. changes to the doctor-patient relationship
      1. black patients would take preventive care suggested by black provider more
      2. blacks also have lower trust in health care system (Tuskegee study; 40 years US gov, conducting study on 400 black men; the men were not informed; most infamous biomedical research study)
      3. doctors' different perceptions of black patients: intelligence, affiliation, pain tolerance

This results in **lowering health spending substantially for black patients conditional on needs**; known fact for 20 years

### Problem formulation
 
#### cost as target
- widely used approach (industry wide)
- not limited to industry

#### alternatige targets
- avoidable future cost (narrower definition): ER cost
- measure of health directly

#### problem formulation challenge
- problem formulation: "turning an often amorphous concept we wish to predict into a concrete variable"
- health is challenging; the idea is holistic and multi-dimentionsal
- label choice is important; but each choice has tradeoffs

### Experiments on label choice

#### 3 labels
1. total cost
2. avoidable cost
3. health (comorbidity)
race is excluded

#### results
- they performed similarly
- concentration in highest-risk patients table
  - the columns are essentially concentraion by their target metric
  - `top_k_df[outcome].sum() / holdout_pred_df[outcome].sum()`
    - top_k_df[outcome].sum(): sum of top k (sorted by that outcome predictor) predicted values of that column label
    - holdout_pred_df[outcome].sum(): sum of all predicted values of that column label
- notice on the black fraction
  - active chronic condition has highest proportion
