The Austin ML Journal Club brings together ML/AI practitioners to explore cutting-edge research through focused discussion and collaborative learning. 

Though "Austin" remains in our name as a nod to our origins, we meet virtually via Zoom—welcoming participants regardless of location. 

We meet monthly(ish) to dive deep into papers that are shaping our rapidly evolving field. We aim to nurture deep conversations and practitioner insights that reveal how the sausages get made.

## Join Us

Interested in joining our discussions? Follow our [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/austin-ml-journal-club) for meeting announcements and registration details. Registration opens before each session and closes 48 hours prior to the meeting.

Want to present a paper? Fill out our [presenter volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8i5kla7LMwN61OPNXCpkyU63qOo2pzgjxhONpPmywLP2yoQ/viewform).

## How We Work

### Meeting Format

We gather virtually via Zoom for 90-minute sessions designed to fit busy professional schedules. Originally meeting in person in Austin, we transitioned to virtual format to address logistical challenges and serve the growing community of interested participants beyond Austin. Each session centers on a single paper that participants read in advance, allowing for substantive technical discussion rather than surface-level summaries.

### Paper Selection

We choose papers that are impactful and seminal in ML/AI, ranging from highly technical research to influential pieces that shape our field's thinking. Our selections prioritize work that offers both theoretical insights and practical relevance, sparking meaningful debate and learning regardless of technical complexity.

### Presentation Format

Sessions are led by volunteer presenters from our community, encouraging diverse perspectives and expertise sharing. The format is entirely up to the presenter - we've never required formal slidedecks or PowerPoints, as sharing the paper itself and guiding discussion is sufficient. This approach reduces preparation barriers and keeps our focus on substantive conversation rather than presentation polish. To ensure sustainability and consistency, **the organizer serves as a backup presenter when needed**, maintaining our regular meeting schedule while fostering community ownership of the learning process.

### Discussion Philosophy

We operate under the **Chatham House Rule** - participants are free to use information shared during meetings, but cannot reveal the source or identity of speakers. This creates a safe space for open intellectual exchange where practitioners can explore ideas, ask questions, and engage in constructive criticism without professional concerns.

### Knowledge Sharing

We publish summaries of our discussions on this blog, capturing key insights and diverse perspectives that emerge from our conversations. These summaries serve both as records for participants and resources for the broader ML community. Our blog is built using Quarto and hosted on GitHub Pages, with pull requests automatically published via GitHub Actions, ensuring a streamlined process for sharing our collective insights. See our [quarto guideline](quarto.md) for blogging tips.

### Community Standards

We maintain a welcoming environment for practitioners at all experience levels - from industry engineers to academic researchers to passionate learners. Our community represents diverse industry domains including hardware, software, fintech, and healthcare, as well as academic backgrounds spanning neuroscience, statistics, electrical engineering, astrophysics, biology, and more. This diversity enriches our discussions by bringing varied perspectives to how machine learning intersects with different fields and problem domains.

## Schedule & Participation

We typically meet late in the month on Thursday evenings at 5:00 PM CT. Registration opens before each session and closes 48 hours prior to maintain focused group dynamics. The club is free and open to anyone interested in advancing their understanding of ML/AI.

## Our Story

The Austin ML Journal Club emerged from a simple recognition: the ML field moves so quickly that staying current with meaningful research is challenging for individual practitioners. While numerous newsletters and articles provide summaries, there's real value in reading papers deeply, examining methodologies critically, and understanding what actually works in practice.

A journal club creates the structure and accountability for this kind of sustained engagement while transforming what could be isolated study into collaborative learning. What began as a group of Austin-based ML practitioners gathering to critique papers and share workplace insights has evolved to serve a broader community of engineers and researchers who value rigorous discussion over surface-level summaries.
