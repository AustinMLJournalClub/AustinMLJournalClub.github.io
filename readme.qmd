If you are interested in joining the journal club, please send an email to <hongsup.shin@pm.me>.

## Logistics
- We meet **every last Thursday of the month** between 6 pm and 8 pm. Meeting announcement is done through our Slack channel.
- We are flexible about where we meet. Hongsup has been hosting the meetings so far and he can provide his place for future meetings as a backup.

## Presentation
- We take turns to present a paper.
- When announcing what to read, we encourage the presenter to write a few sentences about the reason for the pick. This will motivate readers.
- **It doesn't have to be a paper.** It can be a blog post, newspaper article, or even tool documentation. We can also use the journal club as a brainstorming session if the presenter wants to discuss a specific work problem they want to talk about.
- Every presenter will be introduced in the [About](https://austinmljournalclub.github.io/about.html) page with a short bio. Participants will be mentioned in the posts.
- Presenters don't have to know everything in the paper but they should have enough understanding of the paper to lead the discussion.

### Guidelines for choosing papers
Reading papers takes a great deal of time. To respect everyone's time, we encourage presenters to consider the following as acceptable material for the meetings.

- Papers that are published or peer-reviewed
- Papers about ideas that are discussed frequently in the media
- Papers with high citation counts
- Papers from renowned research groups
- Papers that are not too niche in terms of their domain
- Papers that are not too long
- Papers that have many interesting discussing points; this means you can choose a bad paper intentionally


## Communication
- All correspondence happens in our **Slack channel**.
- Presenters should give others **at least 2 weeks to read the paper**.
- Please send a message on Slack about whether you can come next time **at least a week before the meeting**.

## Blogging
- Presenters are welcome to write a blog post about the paper they presented. 
- The blog is hosted through GitHub pages from [our repository](https://github.com/AustinMLJournalClub/AustinMLJournalClub.github.io) and we use the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) platform. 
- You can write about anything in the post as long as it captures some of our discussion during the meeting.
- **Blogging is optional**. If the presenter is too busy to write the post, Hongsup will write a post instead, or he will suggest the presenter to write it together.
