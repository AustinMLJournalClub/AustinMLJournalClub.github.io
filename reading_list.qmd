This page collects papers, books, articles, videos, and other resources suggested by our community for potential future discussions. We welcome suggestions that align with our focus on impactful and seminal machine learning content.

## Current Suggestions

- Hongsup: [AI as Normal Technology](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology)

*This section will be populated with new paper suggestions as our journal club resumes regular meetings.*

## How to Suggest Papers

Have a paper, book chapter, news article, lecture, or other resource you think would spark great discussion? You can:
- Contact the organizer directly
- Submit a suggestion via GitHub issue
- Bring it up during our monthly meetings

We look for content that is impactful, thought-provoking, or offers practical insights into how machine learning works in practice, regardless of format or technical complexity.
